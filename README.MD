The PiFi Digi+ card I bought came with the acrylic case sold at the link above.  The Pi and the attached sound card are not mounted in the case, but rather flop around loosely.  This bothers me, so I designed a bottom that the Pi mounts to, and then used the sides, the top and the brass stand-offs that came with the original case.
